		<p class="date">June 13,2015</p>
		<h2 class="blog">So this is the first post of my blog. Right now I am looking for work while learning to code. This is an interesting time in my life. I am trying to find an entry level web developer position or even an internship. I think that this time in my life is very volatile and difficult. Recently my ex-girlfriend reached out to me saying that she is missing me and wants to get back together BUT I am not sure if I want to or not get back together. A main problem that I am having is that she is not a Christian which is a large part of my life. I want someone who can grow with me in Christ.<br>
			<br>
		Right now I am more focused on my faith as well as trying to start my career. I hope that I can find a job which will help me grow as a developer as well as a person, helping me to adjust to a full time job and learn to be a grown up that can live on my own. Living at home has its benefits but I want to be able to become self sufficient and independant. My goal at this time in life is to become self sufficent, independant and to live on my own within this year.
		<br>
		<br>
		At least I am enjoying my life. Being able to hang out with my church friends has been very helpful or me to stay content in life and keeps me away from becoming depressed.

		<h1 class="post">	The Job Hunt Continues</h1>	
	<p class="date">October 15, 2015</p>
	<h2 class="blog">Since my last post in June, the job hunt has gone almost no where. At some points I was faily saddened by it, but I am coming to terms realizing how difficult the job market is for first time applicants into this field. Hopefully something will come soon, all I need to do is keep my head up and keep searching and practicing my skills.
	<br>
	<br>
	On another note, I have been able to go hiking and spend more times with some old and new friends. It has been a good time with some fun adventures and such. Photos incoming soon! (<a href="photos.html" class="photos" target="_blank">gallery</a>)
