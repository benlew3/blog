            <p class="about">Hi! I am Ben and this is a blog where I will be trying out new things as a developer and practicing my skills
                <br><br>
            I am currently working as a freelance junior front-end developer but also am looking to find a full time gig.
            <br><br>
            Outside of work, I like to be outside backpacking, hiking, anything in the snow, you know, the fun stuff. I am always down to try a new experience in the great outdoors. Recently my friends and I have gotten into hunting for clams, though it is hard due to waiting for low tides. Outside of that, It has been fun.
            <br><br>
            I am interested in learning new things, be it outside or inside. I am always looking to expand myself as a person with a good balance of technology and being outside. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have also posted my resume on the upper right corner if you are interested in getting in contact with me.
